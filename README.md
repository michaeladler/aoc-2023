# 🎄 Advent of Code 2023 Solutions 🎄

Welcome to my repository where I share my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) challenges, tackled using the **good old C programming language**.
Advent of Code is an annual December event where programmers solve fun, holiday-themed puzzles.

## 🛠 Usage

Each puzzle solution is compiled into its own standalone executable, named in accordance with its corresponding day.
For instance, the executable for the first puzzle is `day01`.
By default, these executables search for their respective input files located at `input/dayXX.txt`, where `XX` represents the two-digit day number (e.g., `01` for Day 1).
Alternatively, you have the option to provide input via a command-line argument.
For example, you can run `./day01 mine.txt` to specify a different input file.

## 🏗 Building and Running Tests

Each puzzle in this repository is accompanied by tests, which are designed using both the examples provided in the puzzle and the actual `input.txt` file.
Since sharing the puzzle input data is discouraged, the **inputs are not contained in this repository**.

**Note**: Tests using the actual `input.txt` have to be enabled at compile time with the `-Dhave-inputs=true` option (this only make sense if you have my `input.txt` files since your answers will differ from mine).

### Release Build

```bash
meson setup --buildtype=release -Db_lto=true -Dhave-inputs=true build
ninja -C build test
```

### Debug Build

```bash
meson setup --buildtype=debugoptimized -Db_sanitize=address -Db_lundef=false -Dhave-inputs=true build_debug
ninja -C build_debug test
```

## ⏱ Performance Benchmarks

The solutions were tested on different processors using [hyperfine](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine) and/or [poop](https://github.com/andrewrk/poop):

| Day | Intel i7-11850H | AMD Ryzen 5 PRO 4650U |

| 2   | 185 µs          | 434 µs                |
| 3   | 259 µs          | 501 µs                |
| 4   | 368 µs          | 679 µs                |
